# Project Overview

This project has been created as part of the React Nanodegree from Udacity.
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, a web app is developed that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In the app, users are able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Installation

To run the application please run the following commands (with Node.js already installed).

1. `git clone https://github.com/croepke/reactnd-project-would-you-rather.git`
2. cd into the cloned folder and run `npm install`
3. `npm run`

If everything goes well, the application starts up and is reachable from the browser under `http://localhost:3000`.
